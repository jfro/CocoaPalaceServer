About
==========
I used to use [The Palace](http://www.thepalace.com/) a while back and actually played with creating a server in Cocoa.  Thought I'd share it since I probably won't do anything with it, maybe someone will find it fun.  It's probably not very good code as I wrote it so long ago.

Status
==========
It's been a while but I believe the basics work, connecting & chatting with others.  Props/avatars should also work I believe.  It does compile with a slew of warnings, but there's some problems with the packet class when I tried with OpenPalace flash client.
